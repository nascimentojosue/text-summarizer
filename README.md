This project is a Python-based Text Summarizer Tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate concise summaries from lengthy text inputs. The summarizer tokenizes the input text, calculates word frequencies, and ranks sentences to create a summary based on key points.

## Features
- Summarizes long paragraphs or articles into concise text.
- Utilizes tokenization, stopword removal, and frequency-based scoring.
- Suitable for use in personal projects or as a feature in larger applications.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for this project.
- **NLTK**: A natural language processing library for text tokenization, stopword filtering, and processing.
